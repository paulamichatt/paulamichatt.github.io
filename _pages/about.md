I am a postdoctoral fellow in pulomary and critical care medicine at Stanford University. My research involves studying the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the host-pathogen interaction in pulmonary diseases. I am particularly interested in exploring transcriptomic and proteomic changes in Cystic Fibrosis and Asthma patients who develop severe allergic inflammation due to fungal hypersensitivity. Complete understanding of these interaction will help us identify significant fungal virulence factors and help us define clinically relevant targets for therapeutic use.

I received my PhD in Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics from Bose Institute, University of Calcutta, India in 2019. My dissertation focused on the analysis Of biological networks and insight into the structures of biomolecules associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

Prior to that, I received my Master's degree in Biochemistry in 2012 and Bachelor's degree in Microbiology in 2010, both from University of Calcutta, India.
